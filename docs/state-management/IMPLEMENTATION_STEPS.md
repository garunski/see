# Implementation Steps

Follow these phases in order. Each phase completes ONE page/component before moving on.

## [Phase 1: Setup](PHASE_1_SETUP.md)
Add dependency only. No files created yet.

## [Phase 2: Prompts Page](PHASE_2_PROMPTS_PAGE.md)
Create prompt query and replace prompts page. ONE page at a time.

## [Phase 3: History Page](PHASE_3_HISTORY_PAGE.md)
Create history queries and replace history page. ONE page at a time.

## [Phase 4: Execution Details](PHASE_4_EXECUTION_DETAILS.md)
Add execution query and replace polling. ONE component at a time.

## [Phase 5: Cleanup](PHASE_5_CLEANUP.md)
Remove old code after everything is working.

## Principles

**NO FRONT LOADING**: Create files only when needed for the current page  
**ONE PAGE AT A TIME**: Complete and test each page before moving on  
**HUMAN TESTING**: You manually test each page after implementation  
**QUALITY CHECKS**: Run `task quality` after each phase
