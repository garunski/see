# Custom Workflow Engine Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the development of a custom workflow execution engine to replace `dataflow-rs`, providing native support for pause/resume functionality and parallel task execution.

## Why Custom Engine?

The current `dataflow-rs` engine lacks essential features:
- **No Pause/Resume**: Cannot stop workflows mid-execution
- **No User Input**: No mechanism for human interaction
- **Limited Parallel Processing**: Basic task execution only
- **External Dependency**: Cannot be modified or extended

## Architecture Goals

- **Native Pause/Resume**: Built-in workflow pausing and resuming
- **User Input Support**: Interactive workflows with human approval
- **Parallel Execution**: Concurrent task processing
- **State Persistence**: Workflow state survives app restarts
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new task types
- **Rust-Native**: Built with async/await and Tokio

## Implementation Phases

1. **Phase 1: Sequential Execution** - Basic workflow execution
2. **Phase 2: User Input Handling** - Pause/resume with user interaction
3. **Phase 3: Parallel Processing** - Concurrent task execution
4. **Phase 4: Advanced Features** - Error handling, retries, timeouts

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Workflows execute tasks in correct order
- ✅ Workflows can pause for user input
- ✅ Workflows can resume from pause point
- ✅ Multiple tasks can execute in parallel
- ✅ Workflow state persists across app restarts
- ✅ Performance matches or exceeds dataflow-rs
- ✅ Easy migration from existing workflows

## Timeline

- **Phase 1**: 1-2 weeks
- **Phase 2**: 1-2 weeks  
- **Phase 3**: 1-2 weeks
- **Phase 4**: 1-2 weeks
- **Total**: 4-8 weeks

## Next Steps

1. Review Phase 1 implementation plan
2. Set up development environment
3. Begin with basic sequential execution
4. Iterate through phases with testing
