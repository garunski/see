# Original Problem Statement

## User Request

> "this next feature is extremely complicated so we will need to take it one step at a time. the first iteration we will only be implementing this on the GUI and we will take care of the CLI at a later date. we will be adding a feature for a workflow to be paused to accept user input IF a task is requiring user input. this input will happen on the executions details screen and it will put the workflow and task into a waiting for user state. the initial user input will be just a yes or no button asking if to continue. understand this feature VERY deeply. there are a lot of things to think about during execution like pausing and resuming workflows at arbitrary times and even after app restarts"

## Core Requirements

### 1. **Workflow Pause Mechanism**
- Workflows must be able to pause execution at arbitrary times
- Pause should occur when a task requires user input
- Workflow and task should enter a "waiting for user" state
- Pause should be persistent across app restarts

### 2. **User Input Interface**
- User input should happen on the executions details screen
- Initial implementation: simple yes/no button
- Button should ask "if to continue" (continue/stop workflow)
- Input should be clearly visible and accessible

### 3. **State Management**
- Workflow status: "waiting for user" state
- Task status: "waiting for user" state  
- State must persist across app restarts
- User must manually navigate to execution details to resume

### 4. **Execution Flow**
- Tasks can require user input at any point
- Workflow pauses when input is required
- User provides input via GUI
- Workflow resumes from paused point
- Resume should work even after app restart

## Technical Constraints

### 1. **GUI Only (First Iteration)**
- CLI implementation deferred to later
- Focus on GUI execution details screen
- No command-line user input handling

### 2. **Persistence Requirements**
- Workflow state must survive app restarts
- User input requests must be stored
- Resume functionality must work after restart

### 3. **Arbitrary Pause Points**
- Tasks can pause at any point during execution
- Not limited to specific task types
- Pause can happen before, during, or after task execution

### 4. **Simple Input (Initial)**
- Yes/No button only
- No complex input forms
- No text input or file uploads

## User Experience Requirements

### 1. **Clear Visual Indicators**
- Workflow status should show "waiting for user"
- Task status should show "waiting for user"
- User should know which task is waiting

### 2. **Easy Resume Process**
- User navigates to execution details
- Sees waiting task clearly
- Clicks yes/no to continue
- Workflow resumes automatically

### 3. **No Timeout**
- Workflows should wait indefinitely
- No automatic cancellation
- User controls when to resume

## Implementation Challenges

### 1. **State Reconstruction**
- Must rebuild execution context after restart
- Must know which task was waiting
- Must preserve all execution state

### 2. **Pause/Resume Logic**
- Must pause execution cleanly
- Must resume from exact pause point
- Must handle multiple pause points

### 3. **Database Persistence**
- Must store pause state
- Must store user input requests
- Must handle concurrent access

### 4. **GUI Integration**
- Must detect waiting workflows
- Must show appropriate UI
- Must handle user interactions

## Success Criteria

### 1. **Functional Requirements**
- ✅ Workflows can pause for user input
- ✅ User can provide yes/no input via GUI
- ✅ Workflows resume from pause point
- ✅ State persists across app restarts

### 2. **User Experience**
- ✅ Clear visual indicators of waiting state
- ✅ Easy to find and resume waiting workflows
- ✅ Intuitive yes/no interface
- ✅ No confusion about workflow state

### 3. **Technical Quality**
- ✅ No infinite loops or performance issues
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ Clean code architecture
- ✅ Comprehensive logging

## Failure Analysis

### What Went Wrong
1. **Over-Engineering**: Implemented complex state management system
2. **Infinite Loop**: GUI state management caused infinite database queries
3. **Poor Testing**: No incremental testing of components
4. **Scope Creep**: Added unnecessary complexity beyond requirements

### What Should Have Been Done
1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic pause/resume mechanism
2. **Incremental Development**: Build and test each component
3. **Proper State Management**: Avoid complex GUI state interactions
4. **Focus on Core**: Implement only what's needed for MVP

## Lessons Learned

### 1. **Complexity Management**
- Start with minimal viable feature
- Add complexity only when needed
- Test each component thoroughly

### 2. **State Management**
- Keep GUI state simple
- Avoid complex effect dependencies
- Implement proper error boundaries

### 3. **Database Operations**
- Implement proper caching
- Add rate limiting and debouncing
- Implement circuit breaker patterns

### 4. **User Experience**
- Focus on core user needs
- Keep interface simple and clear
- Test with real users

## Conclusion

The original problem statement was clear and well-defined, but the implementation failed due to:

1. **Over-engineering** a simple feature
2. **Poor state management** causing infinite loops
3. **Insufficient testing** of individual components
4. **Scope creep** beyond the original requirements

The feature should be implemented in much smaller, incremental steps with proper testing at each stage, focusing on the core requirements without unnecessary complexity.
