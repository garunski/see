# User Input Pause Feature - V2 Implementation

## Status: ðŸ“‹ PLANNED

**Date**: December 19, 2024  
**Previous Attempt**: Failed due to infinite loops, compilation errors, and code duplication  
**Approach**: Incremental implementation with mandatory architecture refactoring

## Overview

This folder contains the comprehensive implementation plan for the user input pause feature, designed to avoid all failures from the previous attempt. The feature allows workflows to pause execution and wait for yes/no user input.

## Key Improvements from V1

### 1. **Mandatory Architecture Refactoring**
- Phase 0 eliminates ~150 lines of code duplication BEFORE any feature work
- Single `TaskPersistenceHelper` replaces 6 duplicate code blocks
- Clean foundation for user input pause implementation

### 2. **Incremental Development**
- 7 carefully planned phases, each independently testable
- No use_effect hooks until basic functionality works
- Extensive logging and error handling at each step

### 3. **Failure Prevention**
- Documented potential failures for each phase
- Clear success criteria and testing requirements
- Lessons learned from V1 implementation

## Implementation Order

**CRITICAL**: Phases must be completed in order. No phase can be skipped.

1. **Phase 0** (MANDATORY): Refactor task persistence to eliminate code duplication
2. **Phase 1**: Add WaitingForInput to type system
3. **Phase 2**: Add basic pause/resume to ExecutionContext
4. **Phase 3**: Add GUI status indicators (read-only)
5. **Phase 4**: Add simple resume button (logs only)
6. **Phase 5**: Implement actual resume functionality
7. **Phase 6**: Add simple persistence

## Success Criteria

### Overall Success
- âœ… Workflows can pause for user input
- âœ… User can provide yes/no input via GUI
- âœ… Workflows resume from pause point
- âœ… State persists across app restarts
- âœ… No infinite loops or performance issues
- âœ… No code duplication
- âœ… Clean, maintainable architecture

### Phase Success Criteria
Each phase has specific success criteria documented in its respective file.

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **GUI State Management**: No use_effect hooks until Phase 6+
2. **Code Duplication**: Eliminated in Phase 0
3. **Error Type Confusion**: All functions return CoreError
4. **Move Semantics**: Clone variables before move closures

### Testing Strategy
- Compile after every file edit
- Test each phase independently
- Manual testing before automated testing
- Extensive logging for debugging

## Previous Failure Analysis

The V1 implementation failed due to:

1. **Infinite Loop**: GUI use_effect triggered itself, causing hundreds of database queries per second
2. **17+ Compilation Errors**: Type mismatches, move semantics violations, missing imports
3. **Code Duplication**: ~150 lines of identical task persistence code across handlers
4. **Over-Engineering**: Too much complexity added at once without testing

This V2 implementation addresses all these issues through:
- Mandatory architecture refactoring
- Incremental development with testing
- Documented failure prevention
- Clean separation of concerns

## Getting Started

1. Read `00-architecture-analysis.md` to understand current codebase
2. Follow `01-phase-0-refactor.md` for mandatory refactoring
3. Proceed through phases 1-6 in order
4. Use `10-implementation-checklist.md` to track progress

## Important Notes

- **Phase 0 is MANDATORY** - No exceptions
- **Test each phase** before moving to next
- **No shortcuts** - Follow the plan exactly
- **Document any deviations** - They count as failures
- **Ask questions** if anything is unclear
